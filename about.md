I am an applied AI Engineer with a strong focus on **building end-to-end AI systems that are production-aware**. My work sits at the intersection of **research ideas and practical engineering**, with an emphasis on turning theory into systems that actually run, scale, and can be reasoned about.

## What I build
I primarily work on:
- **Agentic AI systems** (planning, memory, evaluation, orchestration)
- **Forecasting and decision models** for sparse, noisy, or imbalanced data
- **Applied NLP systems**, including prompt optimization, reranking, and evaluation
- **End-to-end ML pipelines**, from feature engineering and modeling to validation and deployment

I enjoy projects that evolve over time—starting from a minimal, working core and progressively adding structure, rigor, and safeguards.

## What I value
- **Reproducibility** over demos  
- **Clear abstractions** over clever hacks  
- **Measured evaluation** over anecdotal success  
- **Incremental system design**, where each phase can be inspected, rolled back, or extended

Most of my projects are documented phase-by-phase, with stable code checkpoints and written design rationale.

## Current focus
My current areas of focus include:
- Building and documenting a **phase-based Travel Planner AI**, evolving from a bare-bones MVP to a more production-ready, evaluated system
- **Prompt compression and example selection**, including reranking methods guided by composite usefulness signals
- Exploring **agent evaluation, observability, and failure modes** in real-world workflows
- Writing structured **research paper reviews** that emphasize intuition, limitations, and applied relevance
