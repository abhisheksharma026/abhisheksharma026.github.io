I am an **AI Engineery**, working on **production-grade AI systems** that sit at the intersection of **research ideas and real-world engineering constraints**. My focus is on building systems that are not only accurate, but **observable, reproducible, and deployable at scale**.

My work spans **agentic AI, large language models, forecasting, and applied machine learning**, with an emphasis on turning theory into production grade systems.

## What I build

I primarily work on:

- **Agentic AI systems** — multi-agent orchestration, routing, planning, memory, and evaluation
- **LLM-powered applications** — RAG pipelines, prompt optimization, reranking, and LLM-as-Judge evaluation
- **Forecasting and decision models** for sparse, noisy, or highly imbalanced data
- **End-to-end ML systems** — from modeling and feature engineering to deployment, monitoring, and iteration

## What I value

- **Reproducibility** over demos  
- **Clear abstractions** over clever hacks  
- **Measured evaluation** over anecdotal success  
- **Incremental system design**, where each phase can be inspected, validated, or rolled back effectively learning & implementing best engineering practices

## Current focus

My current areas of focus include:

- Building **production AI systems** using LLMs, RAG, and agentic architectures
- Designing **multi-agent orchestration and routing systems** for complex workflows
- **Prompt compression and example selection**, including reranking using composite usefulness signals
- **Evaluation, observability, and failure-mode analysis** for AI systems in production
- Writing structured **research paper reviews** that emphasize intuition, limitations, and applied relevance
